      A nebula is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases.
      Originally, the term was used to describe any diffused astronomical object, including galaxies
      beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the
      Andromeda Nebula (and spiral galaxies in general as spiral nebulae) before the true nature of
      galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.

      Most nebulae are of vast size; some are hundreds of light-years in diameter. A nebula that is
      visible to the human eye from Earth would appear larger, but no brighter, from close by. The
      Orion Nebula, the brightest nebula in the sky and occupying an area twice the angular diameter
      of the full Moon, can be viewed with the naked eye but was missed by early astronomers.
      Although denser than the space surrounding them, most nebulae are far less dense than any
      vacuum created on Earth â€“ a nebular cloud the size of the Earth would have a total mass of
      only a few kilograms.
